Picked our widgets, mapped out user stories, and attended a guest lecture by Laurie Voss.

### Challenges
No technical challenges, but several personal ones. Sometimes you just have an off day and I'm looking forward to a fresh attitude tomorrow.

### Actions
I feel good about stepping up as the Trello master and keeping the board organized. We got a lot of user story tickets made and it feels good to get that going.

### Results
Aside from the down moments, I feel like I got the work done today.

### Reflections
Bad days happen. I won't always do or say the exact thing I should every time. Learn from it and get better tomorrow.
