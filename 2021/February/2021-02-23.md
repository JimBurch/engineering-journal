Kicked off FEC, met with groups, planned/researched about overall project structure.

### Challenges
Next.js looks promising but a lot to learn. I was overwhelmed at first when looking through the documentation.

### Actions
I watched some videos that broke it down and tried not to worry about fine details. Also trusted my teammates knowledge on Next.

### Results
I was able to learn a few things quickly and trust that I will be able to learn more as we dive into the project.

### Reflections
Feeling super grateful to be on a STACKED team with good people.
