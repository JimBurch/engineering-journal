Continued researching Next, Hooks, Bootstrap, and discussed strategies with group.

### Challenges
I had to leave for 2 hours to get a last-second chance at the COVID vaccine (I got it!) so I was playing a bit of catch up when I got back.

### Actions
I put in OT after 8pm to crush some tutorials on React hooks and Next JS. I learned a TON and feel great about going into tomorrow.

### Results
My confidence on some of the tech I was previously unsure about is up a lot more.

### Reflections
Good day, learned a lot, but ready to assign widgets and get coding.
