Made tons of progress on FEC and knocked out a lot of small tickets on Trello.

### Challenges
Figuring out problems and when to use Material UI/npm packages and when to focus on vanilla code.

### Actions
I got a lot of things done tonight -- rendered a star rating, drop down to sort reviews, and a numeric overall rating that's looking pretty good.

### Results
Our project overall feels ahead of pace. Excited to record our demo tomorrow night.

### Reflections
Feeling good about the progress. Learning a lot along the way.
